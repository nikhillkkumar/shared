Notes on Learning SQL

p. 7

a foreign key is one or more columns that can be used together to
identify a single row in another table

p. 26

avoid duplicate data (other than foreign keys)
avoid compound columns (putting together distinct pieces of data, for
example, first names and last names, street, city, and zip codes)

include an id column to distinguish between otherwise identical rows
