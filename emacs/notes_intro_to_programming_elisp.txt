Notes for "An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp"
by Robert Chassell


Sec. 1.9.2 Using setq
=====================

(setq cats '(lion tiger leopard))

is the same as

(set 'cats '(lion tiger leopard))

setq automatically quotes the first argument.


Sec. 3.6 let
============

Scoping in Emacs Lisp is dynamic, not lexical (lexical scoping looks at enclosing blocks in the source code, while dynamic scoping looks up the calling stack for a definition)


Sec. 3.9 Truth and Falsehood
============================

The only false value is the empty list (), which is the same as nil.

Humans tend to use 'nil' for 'false' and () for the empty list.

t is the symbol used for 'true'.


Sec. 4.1 Finding more information
=================================

C-h f <name of a function>  To get the full documentation of a function
C-h v <name of a variable>  To get the full documentation of a variable

M-x describe-function  Tells you the location of the function definition
find-tag  To see a function in its original source file
