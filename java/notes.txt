Doc comments can appear above class, method and variable definitions

p. 87 table 4-2 primitive data types
boolean	 true or false, default value is false
char	 16-bit Unicode character, default value is \0 (null character)

Integers
byte	 8-bit, signed, default is 0
short	 16-bit, signed
int		 32-bit, signed
long	 64-bit, signed

Floating-point
float	 32-bit
double	 64-bit

p. 88
variable assignments can be separated by a comma after the type name
double d1 = 3.14, d2 = 2 * 3.14;

when a smaller type is used with a larger one, it is promoted to the larger
type

Integer types wrap around and become negative when overflowing

p. 91
primitives are passed by value, everything else is a reference type and is
passed by reference (a handle or name for an object)

p. 92
if you need to change a caller's reference to an object, you need an extra
level of indirection: wrapping the reference in another object

an interface defines a set of methods and gives it a corresponding type.
an object implementing the methods of the interface can be referred to by
that interface type, as well as its own type.

p. 93
+ and += are the only overloaded operators, adding a String to an int converts
the int to a String
