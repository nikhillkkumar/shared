	  Calling a function with 'new' in front of it treats it as a constructor.

	  By convention, constructors are capitalized.

	  Almost all objects have a prototype, which is returned by
	  Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)

	  The root of the prototype chain is Object.prototype

	  Many objects don't directly have Object.prototype as their prototype,
	  but instead have another object, which provides its own default
	  properties.

	  Object.create(proto) will create an object with the given prototype

	  When it is useful to create objects without prototypes, for example,
	  to ensure all its properties are own properties, we use
	  Object.create(null)

	  All functions, including constructors, automatically get a property
	  named prototype, which by default is an empty object that derives from
	  Object.prototype. Every instance created with this constructor will
	  have this object as its prototype.
