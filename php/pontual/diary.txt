Found PHP-LOGIN project

Figured one page package will lead to bloated application

Installed EasyPHP Dev edition, which triggered a MS 110 dll error

Found solution through about.com, downloaded VC Redist_x86 from MS site

Unpacked php-login-minimal-master files (including index.html) to
C:\Program Files\EasyPHP-DevServer\data\localweb\clientes

looks like I need to rename the login database to pontualimportb1

Going to try the one page solution, using a sqlite file, to avoid the
possibility of a mysql password being sniffed
