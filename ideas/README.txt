Codigo History
==============
(Java, pull structure from Cardex Saver)
A GUI with a list box holding 5 items, and a text box.

Pressing Enter on the textbox activates Robot (if length >= 6) that
types the codigo into Maurilio.

The codigo becomes the bottommost item in the list box. If the codigo is
already in the list box, it is removed from its place and moved to the
bottom.
